# TRANSFORMERS

#### GPT-2:
GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages. GPT-2 is trained with a simple objective: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. The diversity of the dataset causes this simple goal to contain naturally occurring demonstrations of many tasks across diverse domains. GPT-2 is a direct scale-up of GPT, with more than 10X the parameters and trained on more than 10X the amount of data.

#### HUGGING FACE TRANSFORMERS:
ðŸ¤—(Hugging Face) Transformers (formerly known as PyTorch-transformers and PyTorch-pretrained-bert) provides general-purpose architectures (BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLM, DistilBert, XLNetâ€¦) for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) with over 32+ pre-trained models in 100+ languages and deep interoperability between TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch.

Basically Hugging Face Transformers is the mega python package that has some pre-defined or pre-trained functions, pipelines, and models. which we can use for our natural language processing tasks.

GPT-2 Tokenizer and Models are also included in ðŸ¤— Transformers.
